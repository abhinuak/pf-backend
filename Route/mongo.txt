-Show Database display all db's
-use db name redirect to particular db
-show collections:display all collections
-find(): to get all documents from collection
- findOne({email: password:}): prticular data
-find().limit() to display data with a limit
-find().sort({key:1}) sort ascending , -1 descending
-insertMany() -insert multiple documntsx at a time
-insertOne()  -insert single document at a time
-updateOne() -
-updateMany() -
-deleteOne()
deleteMany()



Aggregation operation process multiple documents and return computed results. You can use agregation operation to

grop values from multiple document together 
perfom operation to the grouped data to return a single result 
analysis data changes over time

{
   $lookup:
     {
       from: <collection to join>,
       localField: <field from the input documents>,
       foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
       as: <output array field>
     }

Mongoose
mpngoose.module is one of the most powerffull external module of node.js mongoose is mongodb ODM 
(object database modeling ) that is used to translate the code and its representauion from mongodb to the node js server


Advantage of Mongoose 
collection validation 0f the mongodb database can be done easily
predefined struccture can be implemeted on the collection 
contraints can be applied to document of the collection using mongoose



-install mongoose npm i mongoose
-create folder for defining details
-create a connection file to get connection string from process.env
-import connection to index.js

schema

everything in mongoose with a schema. Each schema maps to a mongoDB collection and defines the shape of the
document within that collection

it can also implement validation
